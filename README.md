# RLBC's Sermons in Podcast Form

This script scrapes and retrieves mp3 files from RLBC's website and publishes them to an RSS feed that updates whenever run!

Formatting user-inputted datestrings is the worst.

## To Do
    - modify url links from squarespace mp3's to dropbox wav files
        * might not even need website parsing at all if info is contained in file name!!
        * would require use of dropbox API--creating shareable web links and acess to folders --> might be easier to automate "when a file is uploaded --> run script"
